This project is inspired by Apple's iPhone announcement in 2007. It abstracts the basic principles of the Jurassic — but revolutionary — iPhone. These principles combine three core functionalities, each based on a different product:

iPod: for listening to music and watching videos (streaming).
Phone: for receiving and making calls, as well as voicemail, contact lists, and more.
Safari (internet browser): for exploring web pages, opening new tabs, sending emails using IMAP or POP3, and more.

The entire project was developed in a more playful and experimental way, rather than aiming for realism. So, it's a simple but logical programming exercise. Thanks for checking it out!
