This project simulates a petshop shower machine. it has functions such as : 
showerPet, verifyWaterLevel, verifyShampooLevel, supplyWater, supplyShampoo, verifyPetShowering, putPetInPosition, removePetPosition, clearMachine and toString.

Each of these functions contains its own business logic and rules.

It was a fun project to build, especially considering that we should all take care of our furry friends. Just because you don't take showers, doesn't mean your little buddy shouldn't haha. Thanks for checking it out!
