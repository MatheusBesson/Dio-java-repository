Another little project. this one is a simulation of a car with a few real properties and functions, but really few. The car accelerates, turn, change gears (I decided to do it automatic, I prefer like it haha).

Maybe later I'll add a horn.

This is another Santander DIO bootcamp challange with study purposes. Thank you for being here.
