This first exercise is a simulation of a bank account using Java and OOP concepts. It has elements such as Balance, Withdrawal, Overdraft funds and Interest Rate based on Overdraft money used by the client.

I tried to make it very complete, but I understand that I didn't use the best logic at all on that one. As soon as possible I pretend to redo it in a way better logic strategy that I already thought during the coding, but I was to frenetic and didn't have enough braincells to restart. not until a coffe break haha.

This is just an exercise to practice and warm up, so look up for other works too. Thanks, nice to have you here!
